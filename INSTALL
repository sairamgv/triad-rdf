The installation instructions are for Linux.


The built scripts will search for dependencies in ~/local first, so
all dependencies can be installed without administrator rights.

1. Install cmake (provided as package "cmake" in every distribution)
   Version 2.8.3 or higher is needed!

2. C/C++ compiler (see Troubleshooting for using correct C/C++ compiler)
   a) gcc-4.7 or gcc-4.4
   b) g++-4.7 or g++-4.4
   c) c++-4.7 or c++-4.4

3. Install mpich2 (>= 1.3.2p1). [Works on 1.4.1p1]
   a) Use a package from your distribution (mpich2 & libmpich2-dev)
   b) Download source code from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/
      and perform the following steps:
      - unpack to ~local/src/mpich2/ and cd to this directory
      - run ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/home/<your-login>/local --enable-mpe 
      - run make  
      - run make install
      - add ~/local/bin to your path (to the front)

4. Install gFortran  (use gfortran package from your distribution)

5. Install libraries: libbz2-dev, lippython2.7-dev, libapr1-dev, libaprutil1-dev

6. Install a recent version of Boost (>= 1.47). [Works on 1.55]
    a) Use package "libboost-dev" from your Linux distribution, if recent enough.
    b) Download source code from http://www.boost.org/ and perform the following
      steps:
      - unpack to ~/local/src/boost_1_47_0 and cd to this directory
      - run ./bootstrap.sh
      - edit project-config.jam and modify the lines below:
      		option.set prefix : /home/<your-login>/local ;
			option.set exec-prefix : /home/<your-login>/local ;
			option.set libdir : /home/<your-login>/local/lib ;
			option.set includedir : /home/<your-login>/local/include ;
      - edit tools/build/v2/user-config.jam and add the line
      		using mpi ;
      - edit boost/mpi/config.hpp and comment out the line "define BOOST_MPI_HOMOGENEOUS" as follows:
            #define BOOST_MPI_HOMOGENEOUS
	  - run ./b2 install

5. Install the log4cxx library. 
	a) Use a package from your distribution (log4cxx & log4cxx-dev OR liblog4cxx10 & liblog4cxx10-dev)
	b) Download source code from http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/download.html
       and perform the following steps:
       - unpack to ~/local/src/apache-log4cxx-0.10.0
       - run ./configure --prefix=/home/<your-login>/local
       - run make               (if this fails, see TROUBLESHOOTING below)
       - run make install

6. Install ccache
   - Use a package from your distribution (ccache)   

7. Install mpi2 libraries
   a) Obtain libraries from https://github.com/uma-pi1/mpi2
   b) To build, cd to <mpi2-root>/build then,
      - run localinstall.sh  (if fails, see troubleshooting)
   

8. To build, cd to <triad-root>/build, then run
   - For optimized build (default; release with CPU-specific optimizations): cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=NativeRelease ../
   - For generic release (release without CPU-specific optimizations): cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
   - For development (never use to measure runtime!): cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
   - make

   After the build is successful, the project can be imported into Eclipse
   (project file is in root directory).

7. (Optionally) Run doxygen in the main directory to create documentation files.   
   
   
   
TROUBLESHOOTING

- If cmake does not find the system's MPI library, you can hint it as follows:
    cmake -DMPI_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/mpich2/ -DMPI_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libmpi.so ../

- If you get relocation errors, try compiling/installing boost with:
  ./bjam --v2 cxxflags=-fPIC install

- triad library has some problems with gcc-4.6 and gcc-4.8, use either gcc-4.4 or 4.7
   * install packages gcc-4.4 or gcc-4.7, g++-4.4 (or) g++-4.7, c++-4.4 (or) c++-4.7 on your system
   * Either
      1) Change the default compiler (recommended)
            sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.* 40
            sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.* 40
     2) add the following lines to your environment (or your ~/.bashrc file)
            export MPICH_CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.* 
            export MPICH_CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.*
   * test by checking "mpicc --version" and "mpicxx --version"

- log4cxx doesn't compile on new gcc versions.
  To fix, add "#include <string.h>" to each of the following files: 
    * src/main/cpp/inputstreamreader.cpp:66: error: 'memmove' was not declared in this scope
    * src/main/cpp/socketoutputstream.cpp:52: error: 'memcpy' was not declared in this scope
    * src/examples/cpp/console.cpp:63: error: 'strcmp' was not declared in this scope
    * add "#include <string.h>" to src/examples/cpp/console.cpp

- Boost libraries not found when using DEBUG build: Build boost with
  ./bjam --variant=debug --layout=versioned --threading=multi install
  ./bjam --variant=release --layout=versioned --threading=multi install
  
- If you see a std::bad_alloc with ALS, try installing libatlas.* and rebuild from scratch
  (this seems to be some bug in lapack)

- update the CMakeLists.txt as follows:
  a. Add 'system' component to Boost COMPONENTS
     find_package(Boost COMPONENTS serialization mpi thread program_options regex system filesystem chrono REQUIRED)
  b. remove examples from compilation
     comment out: #add_subdirectory(examples)
